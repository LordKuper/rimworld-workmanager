# Custom Coding Rules

Project rules that apply only to code and tests. Read by `asd-backend-dev`, `asd-frontend-dev`, `asd-test-engineer`, and impl-review reviewers.

Put here: forbidden libraries/APIs, perf budgets (latency, memory, throughput, regression tolerances), security policy, test coverage thresholds, code-style constraints beyond `.asd/rules/code-style.md`. ASD never overwrites this file.
